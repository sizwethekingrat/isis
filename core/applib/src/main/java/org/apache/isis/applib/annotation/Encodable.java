     * discards the instantiated object. What that means in particular is that a
     * self-encoding class shouldn't encode its own state, it should encode the
     * state of the object passed to it.
     *

     * Implementation note: the default value provided here is simply an empty
     * string because <tt>null</tt> is not a valid default.
